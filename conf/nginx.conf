# Friendica Nginx configuration
# by Olaf Conradi
#
# On Debian based distributions you can add this file to
# /etc/nginx/sites-available
#
# Then customize to your needs. To enable the configuration
# symlink it to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled and reload Nginx using
#
# service nginx reload
##

##
# You should look at the following URL's in order to grasp a solid understanding
# of Nginx configuration files in order to fully unleash the power of Nginx.

# http://wiki.nginx.org/Pitfalls
# http://wiki.nginx.org/QuickStart
# http://wiki.nginx.org/Configuration
##

##
# This configuration assumes your domain is example.net
# You have a separate subdomain friendica.example.net
# You want all Friendica traffic to be https
# You have an SSL certificate and key for your subdomain
# You have PHP FastCGI Process Manager (php5-fpm) running on localhost
# You have Friendica installed in /var/www/friendica
